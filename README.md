My selected excel macros that I mostly do in my work. Sadly it only few of many as due to sensitive info I cannot share them in public.

AnI - small macro make for collegue from work. In only works with his specific excel. Main purpose was to filter people who have license but are not working or have not loged in and people who do not have license currently, but are using it.

CalculateDistance - macro to calculate distance to many warhouses from where we order parts. Its calculate distance automaticaly from google maps and then choose the shortest one.

Swap columns - 5 macros to swap selected column values or merge two columns into one (to left or to right) and combination of these two. Its hard coded and will most likely break if you choose anything except from few cells from two columns.
