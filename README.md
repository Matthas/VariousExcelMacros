My selected excel macros that I mostly do in my work. Sadly it only a few of many as due to sensitive info I cannot share them in public.

AnI - small macro made for a colleague from work. In only works with his specific excel. The main purpose was to filter people who have a license but are not working or have not logged in and people who do not have a license currently but are using it.

CalculateDistance - macro to calculate the distance to many warehouses from where we order parts. Its calculate distance automatically from google maps and then choose the shortest one.

Swap columns - 5 macros to swap selected column values or merge two columns into one (to left or to right) and combination of these two. It's hardcoded and will most likely break if you choose anything except a few cells from two columns.

Insert Picture and resize - Module with macros to paste Picture from clipboard (if it is picture not text) and resize it to the specified size (i.e when we want to fit picture is some form) with option to set saturation to monochromatic.
