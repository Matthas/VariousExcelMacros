My selected excel macros that I mostly do in my work. Sadly it only few of many as due to sensitive info I cannot share them in public.


CalculateDistance - macro to calculate distance to many warhouses from where we order parts. Its calculate distance automaticaly from google maps and then choose the shortest one.

Swap columns - 5 macros to swap selected column values or merge two columns into one (to left or to right) and combination of these two. Its hard coded and will most likely break if you choose anything except from few cells from two columns.
